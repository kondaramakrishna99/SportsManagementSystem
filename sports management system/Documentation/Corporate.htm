  <h1>&quot;Corporate&quot; Template </h1>
  <p>This template has been specifically designed to accommodate large amounts
    of content. It features a three-column, fixed-width layout that includes
     two sidebars, a main menu and individual section menus. Room for
    personalization features has been provided in the left sidebar and you can
    put banners at the top if you wish (though this hasn't been implemented in
     the sample pages). </p>
	<p>Note: general features of this template which are common to all templates 
	are described in the <a href="Default.htm">introduction to the template set</a>. Make sure to read 
	this document first if you haven't done so already.</p>
  <h2>Main features</h2>
  <h3>Themes</h3>
  <p>The template comes with three different themes, called <em>Granite</em>, <em>Sand</em> and <em>Paper</em>.
    The desired theme is set in the web.config file in the application root.
    Set the <code>stylesheetTheme</code> attribute of the <code>pages</code> element
    to the name of one of the themes and view the result in the browser. </p>
  <h3>Menu and breadcrumbs</h3>
  <p>The main menu is an instance of the ASP.NET <code>Menu</code> control spanning
    the top of the center column. Both the menu and the <code>SiteMapPath</code> control
    beneath it derive their content from the <em>web.sitemap</em> file. When
    the user clicks on one of the section links in the top menu, the pages belonging
    to the selected section are displayed in a submenu at the top of the left
    sidebar. This is a second instance of the <code>Menu</code> control
    which is  bound to the application's site map, too. </p>
  <p>If you add new pages to the site, make sure you also place corresponding
    entries in the site map so the pages will be displayed correctly in the top
    and sidebar menus as well as the breadcrumbs.</p>
  <p>Note: dynamic (dropdown or flyout) submenu items for the menus are not supported
  in this release of the template.</p>
  <h3>Source-ordered XHTML </h3>
  <p>If you view the XHTML output of this template, you will notice that the
    main content of each page is placed before the content of both the left and
    right sidebar. This means that search engines won't have to parse lots of
    sidebar content (which is usually secondary in importance) before they get
    to the actual content to be indexed. This is likely to improve your content's
    ranking. </p>
  <h3>Accessibility</h3>
  <p>The master page, the sample pages and the contact form  in <em>Contact.aspx</em> are
    in compliance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/checkpoint-list.html">Priority
      1 checkpoints</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">W3C
      Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 1.0</a>) as well as <a href="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&amp;ID=12#Web">&sect; 1194.22
      of Section 508</a>. Use the techniques shown there for your own pages as
  well, so they'll be accessible for site visitors with disabilities.</p>
  <h3>Database</h3>
  <p>The template includes a SQL Server Express version of the <dfn>pubs</dfn> sample
    database for displaying a list of books on various <em></em> pages.
    You may have to grant read and write permissions on the<em> pubs.mdf</em> file
    located in the application's <em>App_Data</em> directory to the ASP.NET process
    account (ASPNET on IIS 5.x, NETWORK SERVICE on IIS 6) if you encounter errors
  when trying to view the data-driven pages.</p>
  <p>If you don't want to use the SQL Express database, simply change the connection
    string in the <em>connectionStrings</em> section of the <em>web.config</em> file to
  point to a different destination.</p>
  <h3>Designer support </h3>
  <p>The web form designer in Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Web Developer Express
    2005 has been greatly improved over the one contained in Visual Studio 2003.
    Unfortunately, though, it has trouble displaying all three columns of this
    layout next to each other, resulting in the left column being pushed down
    below the content. While this isn't as aesthetically pleasing as it could
    be, you can still edit the content using the designer and take advantage
    of its features. </p>
  <h2>Template structure</h2>
  <p>The three-column grid of this template is based on a reference CSS layout
    called the <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/piefecta-rigid.html"><em>Rigid
    Piefecta</em></a>, which was created by the folks at <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net">positioniseverything.net</a>,
    an excellent resource for all things CSS. 
    See their sample and its source code for a description of how the elements
    work together to make the layout work. </p>
  <p>The <code>div</code> elements in the master page are named according to
    their function so you should be able to understand the purpose of each relatively
    quickly. Comments have been added for clarity.</p>
  <p>As with all  other templates, the look of each theme is achieved by a
    combination of background colors and background images that are assigned
    to specific <code>div</code> elements
    of the master page. See the style sheet for further details. </p>
  <h2>Customizing the template </h2>
  <p>Modifying a template's design to suit your needs is done almost exclusively
    in the CSS and .skin files of a theme. The recommended approach to customizing
    a theme is to make a copy of the one that most closely resembles the look
    you're going for in the <em>App_Themes</em> directory and give it a new name.
    The main areas of customization of this template are: company logo,
    colors, background images and, of course, the content of the page and the
    sidebars.</p>
  <p>Note: be careful when changing dimensions, such as <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>margin</code> etc.
    in the style sheet. The layout, while working stably across across nearly
    all modern browser versions, is composed of a very intricate structure that
    should be changed only after studying and thoroughly understanding the <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/piefecta-rigid.html">Rigid
    Piefecta</a> layout, since even relatively small changes at the wrong place
    can break the layout. This warning applies only to changes to <a href="Default.htm#unsafeProperties">layout-critical
    CSS properties</a> as described in the <a href="Default.htm">general introduction
  to the template set</a>.</p>
  <h3>Company logo</h3>
  <p>The logo is placed in its own div element, aptly named <em>logo</em>. Technically,
    there is no restriction on the width of the logo image, but the
    image height shouldn't exceed the height of the sample logo of each theme. </p>
  <h3>Images</h3>
  <p>The images used to create the design of each theme are stored in the <em>Images</em> subfolder
    of the theme. Some images have very specific widths or heights to make them
    fit into the layout. If you want to stay on the safe side when editing the
    supplied images in a graphics program, try not to change any image dimensions.
    Note that this warning only applies to images used for layout purposes, such
    as background-tiles. There is no restriction on modifying pictures used in
    the page contents, of course.</p>
  <h3>Page and sidebar content </h3>
  <p>Before you start to add content to the pages of your themed application
    it is a good idea to study the sample pages provided with each template as
    well as the master page. Sections that require specific markup are commented
    and contain instructions on what the markup should look like so it will actually
    pick up the styles set in the style sheet and the skin file. </p>
  <p>To simplify managing the sidebar content, you may want to consider encapsulating
    a number of  reusable sidebars in ASP.NET User Controls and then assigning
    these as the content of the sidebar placeholders in the aspx pages. </p>
