    <h1>&quot;Commerce&quot; Template </h1>
    <p>This template has been designed with an online-shopping scenario in mind,
      but it can be used for a wide variety of other purposes as well. Its layout
      consists of three columns with the main navigation menu at the top of the
      page. </p>
    <p>The layout has a &quot;fluid&quot; width, which means that it adjusts
      its size to the user's browser window. While this is nothing spectacular
      in itself, there is some added benefit for users with large
      monitors: the content expands only to a certain point after which it doesn't
      get any wider anymore. The result is greatly increased readability of your
      content since the lines of text will never extend beyond a comfortable
      width. Likewise, the content won't ever be squashed to a point beyond
      legibility when the user narrows the browser window.</p>
	<p>Note: general features of this template which are common to all templates 
	are described in the <a href="Default.htm">introduction to the template set</a>. Make sure to read 
	this document first if you haven't done so already.</p>
    <h2>Main features</h2>
    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <p>The template comes with three distinctly different themes called <em>Magnolia</em>, <em>Jazz</em> and <em>Snow</em>.
      The desired theme is set in the <em>web.config</em> file in the application root.
      Set the <code>stylesheetTheme</code> attribute of the <code>pages</code> element
    to the name of one of the themes and view the result in the browser. </p>
    <h3><a name="fluid" id="fluid"></a>Fluid, but not really</h3>
    <p>As described in the introduction to this template, the content of a page,
      though essentially fluid, will never extend beyond a comfortable reading
      width&#8212; regardless of the width of the user's browser window. This
      behavior is achieved by taking advantage of a very clever CSS layout technique
      named the <em>Jello Mold</em> and invented by <a href="http://uwmike.com/">Mike
      Purvis</a>. Mike has written an <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/jello-expo.html">in-depth
      article</a> explaining the inner workings of the technique. This article
      is highly recommended reading if you plan to make major layout changes
      to the template. </p>
    <h3>Menu</h3>
    <p>The main menu is an instance of the ASP.NET <code>Menu</code> control
      which<code></code> derives the page information from the <em>web.sitemap</em> file
      in the site root directory. If you add new pages to the site, make sure
      you also place corresponding entries in the sitemap so the pages will be
      displayed correctly in the menu. </p>
    <p>Note: dynamic (dropdown) submenu items for the menu are not supported
      in this release of the template.</p>
    <h3>Treeview</h3>
    <p>Some of the  sample pages of this template contain an instance of the
      ASP.NET <code>Treeview</code> control used for simulating hierarchical
      product categories. See the notes on customizing the <code>Treeview</code> <a href="#treeviewCustomization">below</a>. </p>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>The sample pages  of this theme (with the exception of the ones using
      the
      <code>Treeview</code> control) are in compliance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/checkpoint-list.html">Priority
        1 checkpoints</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/">W3C
        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 1.0</a>) as well as <a href="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&amp;ID=12#Web">&sect;&nbsp;1194.22
        of Section 508</a>. Use the techniques shown there for your own pages
        as well, so they'll be accessible for site visitors with disabilities.</p>
    <p>The <code>Treeview</code> control relies on JavaScript for displaying
      child nodes in a hierarchy, which violates paragraph <em>(m)</em>      of <a href="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&amp;ID=12#Web">&sect;&nbsp;194.22
      of Section 508</a>. If your applications
      have to be 100% Section 508-compliant, you may have to forego using the
      <code>Treeview</code> control and use a <code>Menu</code> control instead. </p>
    <h3>Database</h3>
    <p>The template includes a SQL Server Express version of the <dfn>Northwind</dfn> database
      for displaying dynamic product data in various pages. You may have to grant
      read and write permissions on the<em> Northwind.mdf</em> file
      located in the <em>App_Data</em> directory to the ASP.NET process account
      (ASPNET on IIS 5.x, NETWORK SERVICE on IIS 6) if you encounter errors when
    trying to view the data-driven pages. </p>
    <p>If you don't want to use the SQL Express database, simply change the connection
      string in the <em>connectionStrings</em> section of the <em>web.config</em> file
      to point to a different destination. </p>
    <h3>Designer support </h3>
    <p>Due to the complexity of the layout, the web form designer in Visual Studio
      2005 and Visual Web Developer Express 2005 doesn't display
      the master page itself (<em>MasterPage.master</em>) correctly, but editing
      the content pages derived from the master works without problems. </p>
    <h2>Template structure</h2>
    <p>The first thing you'll probably notice when inspecting the master page
      of this template is a set of nested <code>div</code> elements below the <code>body</code> tag
      called <em>sizer</em>, <em>expander</em> and <em>wrapper</em>. These are
      necessary to make the semi-fuid layout (the <em>Jello Mold</em>, see <a href="#fluid">above</a>)
      work. The remaining <code>div</code> elements structure the actual page content.
      Their names indicate their purpose so you should be able to find your way
      around the element hierarchy pretty quickly. </p>
    <p>For stability reasons, the main content <code>div</code> had to be positioned
      after the two sidebar <code>div</code> elements in the XHTML source. To
      avoid burdening users of assistive devices with the sidebar content on
      every page before they can access the main content, a &quot;Skip to main content&quot;
      link has been placed at the top of the template. This link is not visible
      in browsers, but will appear in assistive devices such as screen readers. </p>
    <p>The look of each theme is achieved by a combination of background colors
      and background images that are assigned to specific <code>div</code> elements
      of the master page. See the style sheet for further details. </p>
    <h2>Customizing the template </h2>
    <p>Modifying a template's design to suit your needs is done almost exclusively
      in the CSS and .skin files of a theme. The recommended approach to customizing
      a theme is to make a copy of the one that most closely resembles the look
      you're going for in the <em>App_Themes</em> directory and give it a new
      name. </p>
    <p>The main areas of customization of this template are: company logo, treeview,
        colors, background images and, of course, the page content. </p>
    <h3>Company logo </h3>
    <p>The logo is placed inside the <em>header</em> <code>div</code>. Depending on 
	which theme you decided to customize, the image might need to have a 
	transparent background. The logo image moves horizontally on top of the 
	large header image as the user resizes the browser window, so it needs to 
	look good over various backgrounds.</p>
    <h3><a name="treeviewCustomization" id="treeviewCustomization"></a>Treeview</h3>
	<p>There is a number of ways to customize the <code>Treeview</code> control.
	   You can style the links in the control's skin or rely on the default link
	   format set in the style sheet. The images representing the nodes and their
	   relations can be set using the <code><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.treeview.imageset">ImageSet</a></code> property
	   or you can supply your own images using the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.treeview.collapseimageurl"><code>CollapseImageUrl</code></a>,
	    <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.treeview.expandimageurl"><code>ExpandImageUrl</code></a> and
	    <code><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.treeview.noexpandimageurl">NoExpandImageUrl</a></code> properties.
	    See the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.treeview">MSDN
	    documentation</a> of the <code>Treeview</code> control for further information. </p>
    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>The images used to create the design of each theme are stored in the <em>Images</em> subfolder
      of the theme. Some images have very specific widths or heights to make
      them fit into the layout. If you want to stay on the safe side when editing
      the supplied images in a graphics program, try not to change any image
      dimensions. Note that this warning only applies to images used for layout
      purposes, such as background-tiles. There is no restriction on modifying
      pictures used in the page contents, of course.</p>
    <h4>Page content </h4>
    <p>Before you start to add content to the pages of your themed application
      it is a good idea to study the sample pages provided with each template
      as well as the master page. Sections that require specific markup are commented
      and contain instructions on what the markup should look like so it will
      actually pick up the styles set in the style sheet and the skin file. </p>
	<p>Note: the sample shopping cart is not a complete implementation and 
	merely intended to showcase the themes' design elements.</p>
